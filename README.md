## RuCTF Finals 2023

RuCTF Finals 2023 is an annual online international challenge in the information security.

The contest is driven by classic rules (Attack-Defense CTF). Each team is given a set of vulnerable services. Organizers regulary fill services with private information â€” the flags. The goal of each team is to find vulnerabilities, fix them in their services and exploit them in order to get flags from other teams.

RuCTF Finals 2023 was held on April 22, 2023.
